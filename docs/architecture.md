## Theme-change latency

Live theme changes do not require restarting Zen, but they are not necessarily
instantaneous. Omarchy first stages the new theme, generates its templates,
updates the running shell, and waits for its parallel application integrations
to finish. It then executes the scripts in
`~/.config/omarchy/hooks/theme-set.d/` sequentially and in lexicographic order.

Omazen can generate `palette.json` only when its hook is reached. Other hooks
ordered before Omazen may therefore add to the visible delay. Once the palette
has been written, a shared `inotifywait` subprocess observes the same-directory
atomic rename and immediately wakes every open Zen chrome bridge. A 5-second
safety poll covers lost events while the watcher is healthy. If the watcher
cannot start or exits, every bridge automatically returns to the previous
250 ms polling behavior.

Observed latency depends on the installed hooks, active applications, theme
complexity, and whether an integration performs first-run work. It should not
be treated as a fixed Omazen performance guarantee.

## State contract

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "mode": "dark",
  "accent": "#89b4fa",
  "background": "#1e1e2e",
  "background_dark": "#181825",
  "background_light": "#313244",
  "foreground": "#cdd6f4",
  "foreground_muted": "#6c7086",
  "selection": "#45475a",
  "border": "#585b70"
}
```

The bridge rejects missing keys, unknown keys, wrong schema versions, non-object JSON, modes other than `dark`/`light`, colors other than `#RRGGBB`, and files outside 2–2048 bytes. The JSON cannot supply paths, selectors, CSS or executable text.

## Window behavior

fx-autoconfig injects `omazen-bridge.uc.js` into each top-level browser chrome
document. `OmazenWatcher.sys.mjs` is a process-wide singleton, so all browser
windows share one fixed-command `inotifywait` subprocess while applying the
current palette independently. The bridge observes only the exact
`Browser:About`, `Places:Organizer` and `devtools:toolbox` window types and
applies the same validated palette to existing or later-created About Zen,
Library and Developer Tools windows; other auxiliary windows are ignored. A
later-created browser window reads the existing JSON during initial injection.

`OmazenPalette.sys.mjs` owns the shared color keys, strict palette and payload
validation, WCAG contrast calculation, derived accent foreground selection,
actor payload construction, and root-variable application used by both the
chrome bridge and child actor. The derived foreground is an internal v1 token;
it is not accepted from providers or persisted as a new schema field.

The actor is registered only for a fixed list of internal `about:` documents plus Zen's Spotlight, Firefox's common-dialog and Print documents, and the `chrome://devtools/content/` namespace. This covers Passwords, Translations, Print, Remote Debugging and the in-browser Developer Tools without granting access to ordinary content. It reads validated palette preferences when the actor is created and at `DOMContentLoaded`, and accepts only `Omazen:Apply` messages matching the same strict color contract. It is not registered for `http:`, `https:`, arbitrary extension pages or other chrome namespaces.

The chrome-window `MutationObserver` watches for late internal surfaces but only
schedules a debounced broadcast when an added node is, or contains, a `<browser>`.
The observer and all bridge timers are released when the window unloads.

Passwords, Print and some Developer Tools documents can run in isolated processes that do not instantiate the custom actor. The bridge therefore also registers a Firefox user sheet generated from a fixed template. Its internal-page rules are scoped with `@-moz-document` to the exact Passwords, Translations, Print and DevTools URL families. A separate rule matches `http:`, `https:` and `file:` documents solely to set `scrollbar-color` on their scrollable elements; it does not recolor page content or expose a JavaScript API to web origins. Both sections receive only the already validated palette colors, and the sheet is replaced atomically when the palette changes and unregistered on disable. Print's preview canvas and document remain unmodified, and its system-dialog link continues to hand off to the external GTK/portal surface.

Runtime diagnostics are bounded: before `bridge.log` would exceed 128 KiB, the
bridge replaces `bridge.log.1` with the previous active log and starts a fresh
file. `doctor` reads the archive before the active log so health state remains
continuous across rotation. Bridge CSS probes retry for a short bounded window
before recording an error, and successful palette/CSS events include a stable
per-profile identifier without recording the profile path. `omazen doctor`
compares those events with the current normalized palette and can emit a
machine-readable report with `omazen doctor --json`.

The provider mode and active colors source are persisted as private state files
alongside `palette.json` after setup. This lets an external provider omit its
environment variables on later commands while preserving explicit invocation
overrides.

## Enable and disable

`omazen disable` creates the fixed `~/.local/state/omazen/disabled` marker. Each bridge removes its scope attribute and variables, sets the internal-page preference to disabled and broadcasts a disable message. `omazen enable` removes that marker and atomically rewrites the palette. No restart is involved.

## Application updates

`install.sh` builds a complete application copy in a `mktemp` directory beside
the destination and runs `setup` from that staged tree. A failed setup removes
the staging directory and leaves the active application copy unchanged. After a
successful setup, the old directory is renamed to a timestamped backup and the
staged directory is renamed into place on the same filesystem. This replacement
prevents files removed by newer releases from surviving an update. Stylesheets
have stable canonical source names in the repository, while installation copies
them to release-versioned profile paths. This keeps contributions applicable
across releases without giving up the `chrome://` cache busting required at
runtime.

## Installation ownership

Omazen records only files it created in `~/.local/state/omazen/owned/`, including an expected SHA-256. Upgrades back up owned files before replacement. Uninstall deletes a recorded file only when its current hash still matches the recorded hash; modified files are retained with a warning. Identical pre-existing files are reused but not claimed.
