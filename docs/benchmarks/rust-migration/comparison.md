# Bash versus Rust migration comparison

All supported CLI commands have native Rust implementations: `setup`, `sync`,
`set`, `status`, `doctor`, `disable`, `enable`, `uninstall` and `help`. The shell
entry point was removed after the final mixed-mode and live gates passed. The
installed `bin/omazen` path is now the Rust executable itself, matching the
historical direct-binary measurement; raw Bash artifacts remain here as the
control.

## Disposable `sync` results

Each result contains three runs of 200 measured samples after ten warmups. All
1,200 Bash/final-Rust samples succeeded; no timeout or outlier was removed.

| Implementation | p50 | p95 | p99 | Maximum | p50 change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Bash v1.4.1 (`84d3fd1`) | 84.301 ms | 93.038 ms | 96.615 ms | 105.597 ms | baseline |
| Final Rust dispatcher (`5101fc7`) | 15.938 ms | 18.169 ms | 19.932 ms | 21.172 ms | -81.1% |

The candidate clears the 30% p50 requirement and improves p95/p99. Differential
tests preserve canonical bytes, modes, error output and atomic `MOVED_TO`.

### Optimized Bash control

To separate the language benefit from avoidable work in the original Bash
path, a second campaign applies the same three structural optimizations to the
Bash fallback: one `awk` invocation to validate external palettes, loading
only `common.sh` and `palette.sh` for `sync`, and no redundant validation of
JSON just generated from an already validated palette. The comparison was
rerun in the same session with three runs of 200 samples and ten warmups.

| Implementation | p50 | p95 | p99 | Maximum | p50 change vs optimized Bash |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Optimized Bash via `bin/omazen` | 9.546 ms | 12.265 ms | 13.406 ms | 14.793 ms | baseline |
| Rust via the same `bin/omazen` dispatcher | 4.414 ms | 5.327 ms | 5.791 ms | 6.254 ms | -53.8% |
| Rust binary directly | 3.761 ms | 5.007 ms | 6.000 ms | 7.679 ms | -60.6% |

All 1,800 samples succeeded and no outlier was removed. The public Rust path
remains 53.8% faster at p50 than optimized Bash; the direct-binary row exposes
the remaining launcher cost without using it as the primary comparison. Raw
samples and generated summaries are stored in `bash-optimized/`,
`rust-dispatcher-recomparison/`, and `rust-recomparison/`.

The Bash sampler observed p50 RSS 10.711 MiB and PSS 1.695 MiB. The final mixed
path observed p50 RSS 7.678 MiB for 600 samples and p50 PSS 0.520 MiB for 587
samples. Because 490 short-process observations carry a `/proc` under-run
warning and CPU ticks have only 10 ms resolution, memory and CPU conclusions
remain provisional rather than silently treating missing observations as zero.

The release binary is 786,184 bytes before stripping and 626,712 bytes after
`strip`. It dynamically links only the system C runtime and `libgcc_s`. The one
direct dependency is `sha2`; all locked transitive licenses are recorded in
`docs/rust-dependencies.md`.

### Final direct command path

After qualification and removal of the shell launcher, a confirmation campaign
ran the final direct path for three runs of 200 measured samples after ten
warmups. All 600 samples succeeded: p50 was 2.481 ms, p95 3.300 ms and p99
3.765 ms. The raw data is stored in `rust-direct-final/`. All memory samples
carry the documented short-process `/proc` under-run warning, and CPU remained
below the 10 ms tick resolution, so this campaign supports only the latency
conclusion. Because it was collected in a later session, it is not used as a
same-session replacement for the dispatcher-versus-direct comparison above.

## Correctness gates

- Five differential `sync` fixture families pass.
- Thirteen read-only/diagnostic parity families pass, including JSON, stale
  palette, disabled state and current bridge errors.
- Eight state-changing parity families pass, including failed enable rollback
  and quoted theme names.
- The complete 12-family disposable lifecycle suite passes through Rust,
  including v1.4.0 stylesheet cleanup, known historical preference adoption,
  unknown-file refusal, symlink diagnostics, partial repair, failed staged
  update, backup and uninstall.

## Live integration gate

The requested live campaign passed on 2026-08-27. It covered 1, 4 and 8 Zen
windows with healthy inotify, eight-window forced polling fallback, four
ten-minute idle samples, and three complete Osaka Jade ↔ Catppuccin Latte
cycles with restoration. Across 1,600 latency samples there were no timeouts,
missing windows or duplicate applies. See `live/report.md` and its raw CSV
artifacts for the complete results and retained partial attempts.
